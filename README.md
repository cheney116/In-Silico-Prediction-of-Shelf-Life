# In-Silico-Prediction-of-Shelf-Life

This repository contains the code and data associated with the manuscript "In Silico Prediction of Shelf-Life for Marinated Meat Products Using an Integrative Framework of Machine Learning and Text Mining". This research introduces a novel framework that integrates machine learning (ML) and text mining (TM) to predict the shelf life of marinated meat products. 

## Key Features

* **Data Collection:** A hybrid approach combining text mining and manual literature review to assemble a comprehensive dataset.
* **Feature Engineering:** Evaluation of 16 encoding methods to optimize the representation of categorical features for machine learning.
* **Model Development:** Comparison of 9 ML algorithms to identify the most effective model for shelf-life prediction.
* **Feature Importance Analysis:** Utilizing feature importance scores, SHAP values, and partial dependence plots to understand the key factors influencing shelf life.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Development of a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter to facilitate data input, prediction, and model retraining.

## Repository Contents

* **Data:** Contains the datasets used for training and testing the machine learning models.
* **Figures:** Contains the figures used in the manuscript.
* **Scripts:** Contains the Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation.
* **GUI:** Contains the code and application for the graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is built with Tkinter and provides functionalities for data input, prediction, and model retraining.
